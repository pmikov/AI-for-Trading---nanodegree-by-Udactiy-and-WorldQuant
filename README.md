# Artificial Itelligence for Trading- nanodegree program by Udactiy and WorldQuant

## Part 1: Quantitative Trading 

### Course 1: Basic Quantitative Trading
Lessons: 1) Stock Prices, 2) Market Mechanics, 3) Data Processing, 4) Stock Returns, 5) Momentum Trading

**Course Project : Trading with Momentum**

Generate a trading signal based on a momentum indicator. Compute the signal and produce projected returns. Finally, perform a statistical test to conclude if there is alpha in the signal.

### Course 2: Advanced Quantitative Trading
Lessons: 1) Quant Workflow, 2) Outliers and Filtering Signals, 3) Regression, 4) Time Series Modeling, 5) Volatility, 6) Pairs Trading and Mean Reversion

**Course Project: Breakout Strategy**

Run statistical tests to test for normality and to find alpha. Find outliers and evaluate the effect that filtered outliers could have on the trading signal. Run various scenarios of the model with or without the outliers and decide if the outliers should be kept or not.

### Course 3: Stocks, Indices, and ETFs
Lessons: 1) Stocks, Indices and Funds, 2) ETFs, 3) Portfolio Risk and Return, 4) Portfolio Optimization

**Course Project: Smart Beta and Portfolio Optimization**

Create two portfolios utilizing smart beta methodology and optimization. Evaluate the performance of the portfolios by calculating tracking errors. Calculate the portfolio turnover of and find the best timing to rebalance. Come up with the portfolio weights by analyzing fundamental data, and by quadratic programming.

### Course 4: Factor Investing and Alpha Research
Lessons: 1) Factors, 2) Factor Models and Types of Factors, 3) Risk Factor Models, 4) Time Series and Cross Sectional Risk Models, 5) Risk Factor Models with PCA, 6) Alpha Factors, 7) Alpha Factor Research Methods, 8) Advanced Portfolio Optimization

**Course Project: MultiFactor Model**

Research and generate multiple alpha factors. Apply various techniques to evaluate the performance of the alpha factors and learn to pick the best ones. Formulate an advanced portfolio optimization problem by working with constraints such as risk models, leverage, market neutrality and limits on factor exposures
