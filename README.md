# Artificial Itelligence for Trading- nanodegree program by Udactiy and WorldQuant

## Part 1: Quantitative Trading 

### Course 1: Basic Quantitative Trading
Lessons: 1) Stock Prices, 2) Market Mechanics, 3) Data Processing, 4) Stock Returns, 5) Momentum Trading

**Course Project : [Trading with Momentum](https://github.com/pmikov/Artificial-Intelligence-for-Trading---nanodegree-program/blob/main/Project%201%20-%20Trading%20with%20Momentum.ipynb)**

Generate a trading signal based on a momentum indicator. Compute the signal and produce projected returns. Finally, perform a statistical test to conclude if there is alpha in the signal.

### Course 2: Advanced Quantitative Trading
Lessons: 1) Quant Workflow, 2) Outliers and Filtering Signals, 3) Regression, 4) Time Series Modeling, 5) Volatility, 6) Pairs Trading and Mean Reversion

**Course Project: [Breakout Strategy](https://github.com/pmikov/Artificial-Intelligence-for-Trading---nanodegree-program/blob/main/Project%202%20-%20Breakout%20Strategy.ipynb)**

Run statistical tests to test for normality and to find alpha. Find outliers and evaluate the effect that filtered outliers could have on the trading signal. Run various scenarios of the model with or without the outliers and decide if the outliers should be kept or not.

### Course 3: Stocks, Indices, and ETFs
Lessons: 1) Stocks, Indices and Funds, 2) ETFs, 3) Portfolio Risk and Return, 4) Portfolio Optimization

**Course Project: [Smart Beta and Portfolio Optimization](https://github.com/pmikov/Artificial-Intelligence-for-Trading---nanodegree-program/blob/main/Project%203%20-%20Smart%20Beta%20and%20Portfolio%20Optimization.ipynb)**

Create two portfolios utilizing smart beta methodology and optimization. Evaluate the performance of the portfolios by calculating tracking errors. Calculate the portfolio turnover of and find the best timing to rebalance. Come up with the portfolio weights by analyzing fundamental data, and by quadratic programming.

### Course 4: Factor Investing and Alpha Research
Lessons: 1) Factors, 2) Factor Models and Types of Factors, 3) Risk Factor Models, 4) Time Series and Cross Sectional Risk Models, 5) Risk Factor Models with PCA, 6) Alpha Factors, 7) Alpha Factor Research Methods, 8) Advanced Portfolio Optimization

**Course Project: [MultiFactor Model](https://github.com/pmikov/Artificial-Intelligence-for-Trading---nanodegree-program/blob/main/Project%204%20-%20Multifactor%20Model.ipynb)**

Research and generate multiple alpha factors. Apply various techniques to evaluate the performance of the alpha factors and learn to pick the best ones. Formulate an advanced portfolio optimization problem by working with constraints such as risk models, leverage, market neutrality and limits on factor exposures.

## Part 2: AI Algorithms in Trading

### Course 5: Sentiment Analysis with Natural Language Processing
Lessons: 1) Intro to Natural Language Processing, 2) Text Processing, 3) Feature Extraction, 4) Financial Statements, 5) Basic NLP Analysis

**Course Project: Sentiment Analysis using NLP**

Apply Natural Language Processing on corporate filings, such as 10Q and 10K statements, from cleaning data and text processing, to feature extraction and modeling. Utilize bag-of-words and TF-IDF to generate company-specific sentiments. Based on the sentiments, decide which company to invest in, and the optimal time to buy or sell.

### Course 6: Advanced Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning
Lessons: 1) Introduction to Neural Networks, 2) Training Neural Networks, 3) Deep Learning with PyTorch, 4) Recurrent Neural Networks, 5) Embeddings & Word2Vec, 6) Sentiment Prediction RNN

**Course Project: Sentiment Analysis with Neural Networks**

Build deep neural networks to process and interpret news data. Play with different ways of embedding words into vectors. Construct and train LSTM networks for sentiment classification. Run backtests and apply the models to news data for signal generation.

### Course 7: Combining Multiple Signals
Lessons: 1) Overview, 2) Decision Trees, 3) Model Testing and Evaluation, 4) Random Forests, 5) Feature Engineering, 6) Overlapping Labels, 7) Feature Importance

**Course Project: Combining Signals for Enhanced Alpha**

Combine signals on a random forest for enhanced alpha. While implementing this, solve the problem of overlapping samples. For the dataset, use the end of day from Quotemedia and sector data from Sharadar.

### Course 8: Backtesting - Simulating Trades with Historical Data
Lessons: 1) Intro to Backtesting, 2) Optimization with Transaction Costs, 3) Attribution

**Course Project: Backtesting**

Build a fairly realistic backtester that uses the Barra data. The backtester will perform portfolio optimization that includes transaction costs. Implement it with computational efficiency in mind, to allow for a reasonably fast backtest. Use performance attribution to identify the major drivers of portfolio's profit-and-loss (PnL).
