Now, keeping in mind that we need to be able to make replacements later we will use groups to be able to distinguish between the first name, the middle name, and the last name. Since all names have a first name then we can use this group `([a-zA-z]+)` to match all the first names. Now, not all names have middle names, so having a middle name is optional. Since the first and middle name are separated by a whitespace we also need to indicate that the whitespace is also optional. So, to do indicate that the whitespace and middle name are optional we will include the `?` metacharacter after the whitespace and second group, `[ ]?([a-zA-z]+)?`. After the first or middle name we have a whitespace that we can match with `\\[  \\]`. Notice that in this case we didn't use the sequence `\\\\s` since this will match newlines as well and we don't what match those. Finally we make a third group to match the last name. Since all names have last names, we don't need to use the `?` metacharacter. Putting all together we get:"

    "We saw at the beginning of this lesson that regexes are case sensitive, therefore we often have to use regexes with both uppercase and lower case letters. However, the `re.compile(pattern, flags)` function, has a `flag` keyword that can be used to allow more flexibility. For example, the `re.IGNORECASE` flag can be used to perform **case-insensitive** matching. In the code below we have a string that contains the name Walter written in two different combinations of upper and lower case letters. In order to be able to find this two renditions of Walter, we will probably have to use a long character set to be able to account for all possible combinations of lower and upper case letters. However, in this case we can use the `re.IGNORECASE` to indicate that we don't care about the case of the letters, we just want to find the name Walter no matter how it is written. Let's see how this works:"
